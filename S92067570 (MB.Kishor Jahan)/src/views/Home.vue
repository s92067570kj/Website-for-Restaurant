      <h2>1.Pot Buriyani</h2>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        Biryani is traditionally associated with the Mughlai cuisine . In
        chicken pot biryani version where all the ingredients are placed in one
        pot and cooked on the stove top.

      </p>
      <p class="col-8 para para1">
        It probably comes as no surprise that I cook fried rice very frequently.
        Not only do I find this dish comforting, but it is also darn easy to
        make. All you really need is rice, eggs, vegetables, and soy sauce. Once
        you get into the rhythm of this basic egg fried rice recipe, play around
        with it!

      <h2>3.Lucknowi Biryani</h2>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        On the other hand, Lucknowi Biryani has a uniquely delicate flavor and
        rich fragrance. In preparing this unique dish, the meat and the rice are
        cooked separately and then layered in a pot that is placed over a low
        flame. Many chefs also add a little-concentrated stock to the rice to
        flavor it.

      <h2>4.Calcutta Biryani.</h2>
      <p class="col-4">
        <img src="../assets/Images/2.jpg" height="300px" width="350px" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p class="col-8 para para1">
        The Kolkata biryani, traditionally, is a dish where the meat and the
        potatoes are slow cooked in clarified butter, on low heat (dumpukht).
        The uncooked rice, the meat and potatoes are then layered in a big-based
        pot (handi) to which certain spices such as cardamom, mace, saffron,
        cloves and sweet ittar are added.
      </p>

      <!-- 5th image -->
      <h2>5.Appam</h2>
      <p class="col-8 para">
        Appams are served with vegetable stew, kadala curry (chickpea curry),
        potato stew, vegetable korma, coconut chutney or coconut milk sweetened
        with jaggery. To make my favorite sweet coconut milk for pairing with
        palappam, the coconut milk is sweetened with jaggery and flavored with
        cardamom powder.
